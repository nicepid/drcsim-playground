Just add this at the end of your `~/.bashrc` using your favourite editor.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# If glob result is empty, give empty result instead of the literal glob\r\nshopt -s nullglob\r\n\r\n# Add subdirectories of any folder in '~/local' to paths\r\nfor dir in $HOME/local/*/; do\r\n  export PATH=\"${dir}bin:$PATH\"\r\n  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"${dir}lib:${dir}lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\r\n  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"${dir}lib/pkgconfig:${dir}lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Restore behaviour, so tab-complete works\r\nshopt -u nullglob\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd let's make the directory itself too:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p ~/src\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installing Gazebo\r\n\r\nGazebo is a an extendable robot simulator that DRCSim is build on top of - actually DRCSim is mostly a lot of assets and plugins for Gazebo.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
